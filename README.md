### Hello everyone!! 👋

I am a student of "computer science" 🖥, I love technology📡 and I love to learn new things📝, I am currently studying everything related to Web Development🌐 but focused on the backend. I like to talk about music🎶, technology and personal growth🙅‍, sometimes (very rarely) I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gabomunozcastro) . You can find me the [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goonies/). I'm working on a personal website so I can publish some articles and be able to communicate more directly :)
